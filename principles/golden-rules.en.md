# The Ten Golden Rules of Vibe Coding

*A collection of core principles guiding effective human-AI collaboration in software development.*

[English](../../en/principles/golden-rules.md) | [中文](../../zh/principles/golden-rules.md)

## 1. Cognitive Augmentation & Capability Expansion

### Core Concept
Human-AI collaboration is not simply about division of labor, but a symbiotic evolutionary partnership of complementary capabilities. AI is not just a tool, but a partner for cognitive extension and capability amplification.

### Practical Guidelines
- Utilize AI for repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on creative thinking
- Cultivate "prompt engineering" skills to effectively guide AI in complex tasks
- Focus on the "fit" between AI models and the team, with personalized tuning
- Establish an open culture that encourages experimentation and continuous learning

## 2. Isomorphic Mapping of Intent

### Core Concept
Human high-level intentions should be accurately mapped to AI understanding and execution through clear expression, maintaining the integrity and consistency of intent.

### Practical Guidelines
- Adopt structured requirement descriptions and intent expressions
- Establish intent-code traceability mechanisms
- Pay attention to intent remapping when requirements change
- Tools should support end-to-end traceability from requirements to code

## 3. Order from Entropy Reduction & Consensus Reality

### Core Concept
Reduce system entropy through explicit rules, shared knowledge, and team consensus, forming a clear "order space" and "consensus reality."

### Practical Guidelines
- Build high-quality rule repositories and knowledge bases
- Form "living documentation" systems to record conventions, decisions, and evolutionary history
- Maintain consistency in code style, naming conventions, and architecture
- Enhance team recognition of the "consensus reality"

## 4. Divide & Conquer for Emergence

### Core Concept
Break down complex problems into smaller tasks that AI can effectively handle, while coordinating the combination of these subtasks to promote the emergence of higher-level functions.

### Practical Guidelines
- Create "AI-friendly" architectural designs with clear boundaries
- Break large tasks into independently executable chunks
- Consider "AI comprehensibility" when designing APIs and interfaces
- Optimize workflows and interaction rhythms between humans and AI

## 5. Memory & Navigation in State Space

### Core Concept
Maintain persistent project memory and context to support AI navigation in complex state spaces, forming an iterative evolutionary development engine.

### Practical Guidelines
- Establish a "project memory repository" including codebase, decision history, and key context
- Design effective "navigation maps" to help AI understand project structure
- Create feedback loop mechanisms for progressive improvement
- Emphasize the completeness and traceability of change history

## 6. Adaptive Mutation of Explicit Covenants

### Core Concept
Clearly define AI behavior rules while allowing these rules to adaptively adjust as the project evolves, achieving the sedimentation and sublimation of collective wisdom.

### Practical Guidelines
- Manage rules as "configuration as code" or "living documentation"
- Establish regular review and "rule health check" mechanisms
- Balance rule stability with flexibility for innovation
- Ensure new rules align with system evolution direction

## 7. Fidelity & Amplification of Value Stream

### Core Concept
Ensure high-fidelity transmission of value from requirements to delivery throughout the entire process, using AI as a value stream amplifier while building system resilience.

### Practical Guidelines
- Drive requirement definition and prioritization with user value
- Advance full-process automation and observability
- Apply AI to code generation, test automation, and other stages
- Build "AI-enhanced" quality assurance mechanisms

## 8. Dynamic Entitlement & Instantaneous Containment

### Core Concept
Dynamically adjust AI permission boundaries based on context and risk, while establishing rapid response mechanisms to prevent potential risks.

### Practical Guidelines
- Implement the "principle of least privilege," adjusting permissions dynamically based on tasks
- Set safety thresholds and human confirmation for dangerous operations
- Establish anomaly detection and rapid response mechanisms
- Regularly evaluate and update permission policies

## 9. Controlled Integrity of Change Units

### Core Concept
Ensure each change has atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability, preventing AI-generated code from introducing system inconsistencies.

### Practical Guidelines
- Design "transactional" AI code generation and modification processes
- Establish consistency verification mechanisms before and after changes
- Implement fine-grained code review and testing strategies
- Focus on the boundary effects and cross-cutting concerns of changes

## 10. Closed-Loop Autonomy of Quality Calibration Circuits

### Core Concept
Establish automated quality feedback mechanisms, forming a closed-loop system from detection to adjustment, achieving continuous quality assurance.

### Practical Guidelines
- Build high-coverage automated test pyramids
- Implement continuous integration and deployment infrastructure
- Establish multi-dimensional quality monitoring systems
- Connect quality metrics with AI behavior adjustment mechanisms

## Epilogue

The ten golden rules of Vibe Coding are not only a profound reflection and systematic distillation of current AI-assisted development practices but also an active conception and proactive shaping of future software engineering development directions. They need to be continuously tested, enriched, and developed through the collective practice, continuous reflection, and selfless sharing of global developers.

This is an era where software development is no longer just a stack of logic, but a creative symphony of human wisdom and machine intelligence interacting with each other, full of "Vibe" (vitality, atmosphere, resonance).
