*Cursor feature overview and mapping to Vibe Coding principles*

[English](../../../en/ai-ide/cursor/overview.md) | [中文](../../../zh/ai-ide/cursor/overview.md)

## Cursor Introduction

Cursor is a modern IDE designed specifically for AI-assisted programming, integrating intelligent assistance based on large language models. Its powerful code generation, refactoring, and explanation capabilities make it an ideal tool for practicing Vibe Coding principles.

## Core Features and Vibe Coding Mapping

| Cursor Feature | Description | Corresponding Vibe Coding Principle |
|------------|------|-------------------|
| **Rules System** | Custom AI behavior rule configuration | Adaptive Mutation of Explicit Covenants, Order from Entropy Reduction |
| **Notepad** | Project notes and context memory | Memory & Navigation, Consensus Reality |
| **Instructions.md** | Project-level guidance and constraints | Isomorphic Mapping of Intent, Order from Entropy Reduction |
| **Conversation History** | Interaction records and context maintenance | Memory & Navigation |
| **Code Generation** | Intelligent code completion and generation | Fidelity & Amplification of Value Stream |
| **Documentation Generation** | Automatic creation and updating of documentation | Closed-Loop Autonomy of Quality Calibration Circuits, Memory & Navigation |

## Cursor Configuration Best Practices

### 1. Project Initialization Configuration

Configure the Cursor environment for new projects, establishing the foundation for Vibe Coding:

1. Create the `.cursor` directory structure
2. Set up basic Rules defining AI behavior standards
3. Create `instructions.md` describing project goals and constraints
4. Set up project Notepad to record key decisions and context

### 2. Rules System Usage Guide

Cursor's Rules system is the core mechanism for implementing Vibe Coding's explicit covenants:

- **Organizational Structure**: Organize `.mdc` files in a modular way, categorized by function or domain
- **Rule Levels**: Distinguish between global rules and scenario-specific rules
- **Update Mechanism**: Establish rule review and update processes
- **Testing Validation**: Methods for validating rule effectiveness

### 3. Notepad Best Practices

Effective use of Notepad to build a project memory system:

- **Content Organization**: Structured recording of project knowledge and decisions
- **Linking Mechanism**: Cross-references with the codebase and documentation
- **Maintenance Strategy**: Keeping Notepad content updated and streamlined
- **Collaboration Method**: Team sharing and exchange of Notepad content

### 4. Conversation History Management

Manage Cursor conversation history to maintain context continuity:

- **Session Organization**: Organize conversations by functionality and topic
- **Key Information Extraction**: Capture important information from conversations into Notepad
- **Context Switching**: Efficiently switch between different contexts
- **Long-term Memory Strategy**: Handle historical information beyond the context window

## Implementing Vibe Coding Playbooks

### Requirements Analysis Implementation

```
Implementing the Requirements Analysis Playbook in Cursor:

1. Create a dedicated requirements analysis Notepad
2. Configure requirements-specific Rules (see rules/requirements.mdc)
3. Use structured prompt templates to record requirements
4. Save key decisions and constraints to project Instructions.md
```

### Design Implementation

```
Implementing the Design Playbook in Cursor:

1. Create architecture and design-specific Notepad
2. Configure design-specific Rules (see rules/design.mdc)
3. Use diagrams and structured documents to record design decisions
4. Establish traceability between design decisions and requirements
```

### Implementation and Maintenance Support

```
Supporting implementation and maintenance in Cursor:

1. Configure rules for code generation and refactoring (see rules/implementation.mdc)
2. Establish prompt templates for code review and quality checks
3. Create dialogue flows for technical debt identification and management
4. Use Notepad to record implementation experiences and best practices
```
